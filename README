A Theorem Prover for Lambek-Grishin Calculus

Formula language:
        A,B ::= p |             atoms (use alphanum)
        A*B | B\A | A/B |       product
        A(*)B | A(/)B | A(\)B   coproduct
        =>                      inference
        
To use LaTeX commands as atoms, use |.
For example: |phi will be translated to \phi

Example call: python LGprover.py "np/n, n => np"

To print to TeX, use -t. 
So far this uses a method of printing written for 
printing a single module, so the output is only
really useful for debugging.

usage of a lexicon is now supported (basic)
For all options see argparser.py or use --help
